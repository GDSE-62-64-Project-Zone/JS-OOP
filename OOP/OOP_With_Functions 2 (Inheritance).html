<h1>OOP with JS Functions</h1>

<script>

    //So then what about inheritance
    //JS is supporting for inheritance.?
    //Yes, But with a use of prototype

    //So what are prototypes?
    //Prototypes are objects which is automatically defined with objects to maintain the inheritance hierarchy
    //in js

    //What are the properties which involving in inheritance hierarchy
    //prototype. (include inside all functions)
    //__proto__ (includes in every Object and Functions)
    //constructor (inside the prototype)

    //So what is the usage of prototype property
    //As I mentioned earlier this property is inside the functions, and it's the
    //link to its prototype object

    //__proto__
    //This can find inside every object and functions, this property will help you to find out
    //what is the direct link of inheritance to the object or function

    //Constructor
    //This property which is inside the prototype object is used to relink its function
    //when you are inside a prototype this property will help you to finds its function


    function Vehicle(make,year){
        this.make=make;
        this.year=year;
        this.park=function(){
            console.log(`${this.make}-${this.year} is Parking`)
        }
    }
    function BMW(make,year){
        Vehicle.apply(this,arguments); //copy all the Vehicle properties to the BMW function
    }

    //make bmw prototype into a subtype of Vehicle prototype
    BMW.prototype.__proto__=Vehicle.prototype;


    var v= new Vehicle("Vehicle","2022")
    v.park();

    var bmw = new BMW("BMW C001","2023");
    bmw.park();

    //So we can check inheritance hierarchy is working properly or not
    //Let's add some properties to the parent function Vehicle
    Vehicle.prototype.vehicleTest='testingVehicle';

    v.vehicleTest;//can access
    console.log(v.vehicleTest)

    // what about bmw.?
    bmw.vehicleTest;//can access
    console.log(bmw.vehicleTest)
    //so that means after we added some properties to the super type vehicle we can
    //access it from the subtype BMW

    //So let's check the other side
    BMW.prototype.bmwTest='testingBMW';
    bmw.bmwTest; //can access
    console.log(bmw.bmwTest)

    // what about accessing this from the super type vehicle

    v.bmwTest; //this is undefined. we cannot access subtype properties from the supertype because
    //inheritance is not supporting something like that
    console.log(v.bmwTest)
