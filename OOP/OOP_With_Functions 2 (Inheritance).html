<h1>OOP with JS Functions</h1>

<script>

    //So then what about inheritance
    //JS is supporting for inheritance.?
    //Yes, But with a use of prototype

    //So what are prototypes?
    //Prototypes are objects which is automatically defined with objects to maintain the inheritance hierarchy
    //in js

    //What are the properties which involving in inheritance hierarchy
    //prototype. (include inside all functions)
    //__proto__ (includes in every Object and Functions)
    //constructor (inside the prototype)

    //So what is the usage of prototype property
    //As I mentioned earlier this property is inside the functions, and it's the
    //link to its prototype object

    //__proto__
    //This can find inside every object and functions, this property will help you to find out
    //what is the direct link of inheritance to the object or function

    //Constructor
    //This property which is inside the prototype object is used to relink its function
    //when you are inside a prototype this property will help you to finds its function


    function Vehicle(make,year){
        this.make=make;
        this.year=year;
        this.park=function(){
            console.log(`${this.make}-${this.year} is Parking`)
        }
    }
    function BMW(make,year){
        Vehicle.apply(this,arguments);
    }

    BMW.prototype.__proto__=Vehicle.prototype;

    var v= new Vehicle("Vehicle","2022")
    v.park();


    var bmw = new BMW("BMW C001","2023");
    bmw.park();
