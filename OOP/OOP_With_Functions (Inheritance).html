<h1>OOP with JS Functions</h1>

<script>

    //So then what about inheritance
    //JS is supporting for inheritance.?
    //Yes, But with a use of prototype

    //So what are prototypes?
    //Prototypes are objects which is automatically defined with objects to maintain the inheritance hierarchy
    //in js

    //What are the properties which involving in inheritance hierarchy
    //prototype. (include inside all functions)
    //__proto__ (includes in every Object and Functions)
    //constructor (inside the prototype)

    //So what is the usage of prototype property
    //As I mentioned earlier this property is inside the functions, and it's the
    //link to its prototype object

    //__proto__
    //This can find inside every object and functions, this property will help you to find out
    //what is the direct link of inheritance to the object or function

    //Constructor
    //This property which is inside the prototype object is used to relink its function
    //when you are inside a prototype this property will help you to finds its function



    function Customer(){
        this.id="C001";
    }
    var c= new Customer();

    let item={
        code:"I001"
    }

    Object.prototype==item.__proto__
   // true

    Function.prototype==item.__proto__
   // false
