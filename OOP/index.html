    //Create a js literal base object for company  including data
    //Company name
    //Company address
    //Company TP
    //Company foundYear
    //Company monthlyIncome

    //Please make sure to convert all the properties to private
    //You know js properties can delete at any time. so I want to stop deleting all the  properties
    //I want to foundYear property value to final state, which means the value which assigned for the found year cannot be changed
    //Monthly income property should not have a direct value, so the value should later assign

    //Please note, that you are only allowed to use literal base objects for this

//named value container
    let company={
        name:"IJSE",
        address:"Galle",
        tp:"077123456",
        foundYear:"2004",
        monthlyIncome:100
    }

    company.id;

    //How to get the public keys of an object
    //first method
    Object.keys(company);

    //second method
    // for(var i in company){
    //     console.log(i);
    // }


    //can we delete a property of an object
    // delete company.name; //yes


    //how to change a value of an object property
    // company.foundYear="2005";


//Property Descriptors
//Enumerable
//Configurable
//Writable
// value

    //So how to check those property descriptors for a object property
    // Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(); // here we can use this method

    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(company,'address'); //will return the address property descriptors
    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(company,'name');//will return the name property descriptors
    // {
    //     configurable:true,
    //     enumerable:true,
    //     value:"Galle",
    //     writable:true
    // }

    //So can we change these descriptors as we want
    //yes this is how to do it
    Object.defineProperty(company,'name',{
        writable: false
    });
    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(company,'name');
    // {
    //     configurable:true,
    //     enumerable:true,
    //     value:"Galle",
    //     writable:false //now this is false
    // }

    //So what will happen with this to name.?
