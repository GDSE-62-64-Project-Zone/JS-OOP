    //Company name
    //Company address
    //Company TP
    //Company foundYear
    //Company monthlyIncome

    //Please make sure to convert all the properties to private
    //You know js properties can delete at any time. so I want to stop deleting all the  properties
    //I want to foundYear property value to final state, which means the value which assigned for the found year cannot be changed
    //Monthly income property should not have a direct value, so the value should later assign

    //Please note, that you are only allowed to use literal base objects for this
